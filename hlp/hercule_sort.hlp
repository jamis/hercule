From this screen you can specify whether you want the clues to be automatically sorted when a new puzzle is generated.  If 'Auto Sort' is unchecked, clues will be given in random order.

If 'Auto Sort' is checked, clues will be sorted according to the following four pop-up lists.  The 'First' one specifies what type of clue will be listed first, followed by the 'Second' type of clue, etc.

Even if Auto Sort is unchecked, you may still sort clues by opening this form during a puzzle and tapping the 'Sort' button.  (The 'sort' button is not visible when a puzzle is not in progress.)
