This is what comes of playing the game with the "warn on bad assumptions" preference unchecked.  Somewhere, you made a wrong assumption and didn't catch it, and now you've reached the end of the game with a wrong tile asserted somewhere.

You can either:

· click "undo" to back up (but you can only go back 15 moves that way)

· click "reset" to restart the current puzzle

· click on a solved square to reset that square back to all possibilities.

Good luck!
