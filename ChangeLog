v1.33 (10 Oct 2003)
  - If total seconds played exceeded 64k, it would reset to 0.  The total
    number of seconds should now be sufficient to represent a over 134 years
    of game time.

v1.32 (30 Oct 2002)
  - Added games played and average game time statistics, with corresponding
    window for viewing and resetting those stats.
  - Added a "clue swap" feature for toggling the hidden state of each clue.
  - Fixed potential crash when the "New Puzzle" window is closed by pressing
    the "Cancel" button.

v1.31 (2 May 2002)
  - no changes made from 1.31-pre1

v1.31-pre1 (25 Apr 2002 -- limited release)
  - fixed bug where tapping 'home' on the win dialog would result in the
    puzzle number not being incremented.
  - upgraded prc-tools, in the hope that this will fix Todd Redden's problems
    with running Hercule in flash.

v1.3 (15 Apr 2002)
  - fixed a few minor potential memory leaks (frmCloseEvent is not called
    on FrmReturnToForm).
  - fixed bug when clicking below the clues when clues are displayed
    vertically -- a clue that was not clicked recieved the event.
  - Puzzle number was not incremented (or incremented twice) in certain
    situations.
  - fixed bug causing vertically listed clues to be listed in too many
    rows.
  - removed redundant background tiles from color version.
  - Changed 'Next'/'OK' buttons on Win dialog to just 'OK'.  If auto-advance
    is on, clicking 'OK' will automatically take you to the next puzzle.  If
    auto-advance is off, clicking OK will return you to the puzzle you just
    finished.
  - Added arrow, punctuation, and music notation tilesets.

v1.3-pre4 (12 Apr 2002)
  - Put shapes tiles back (removed fruits/veggies tiles)
  - Replaced number tiles with colors.
  - Touched up letter and die tiles.
  - Added documentation to tutorial.
  - Changed 'OK'/'Cancel' buttons on Win dialog to 'Next'/'OK'.
  - Added option to select tiles used for each row.
  - Added Greek tileset (thanks to Eric Shen for the idea).

v1.3-pre3 (8 Apr 2002)
  - If a puzzle was finished, 'cancel' pressed, and then the game exited,
    the next time Hercule was started, the puzzle presented to the user
    by default was the one they had just finished.  The seed is now
    incremented to account for this when the game is exited while viewing
    a finished game.
  - Replaced 'shapes' tiles with 'fruits/vegetables' tiles from Sean Evans.
  - Added countdown timer on game screen (show/hide via the preferences).
  - Custom clue sort orders.
  - Changed the 4bpp logo screen (again).
  - Clues disappearing automatically on puzzle start has been fixed.
  - Customizable clue read-order specification (left-to-right or
    top-to-bottom) via preferences.

v1.3-pre2 (3 Apr 2002)
  - Fixed color-depth calculation -- it now chooses the lowest color
    resolution consistent with the device, but at least 8-bpp.
  - Made the 'page-down' key not send any events, so that the system
    tick does not go off when you hold it down.
  - Added 'cancel' button on win dialog, to allow you to return to the
    game board to view the solution.  Tapping after a win does not
    do anything.
  - Added 'Next Puzzle' to menu, to allow you to move to the next
    puzzle number quickly.

  - Color!
  - Puzzle number & handicap now show in the bottom left of the puzzle
    screen.

v1.22 (29 Mar 2002):
  - sort clues so that vertical clues sort after horizontal clues

    currently selected operation.

  - made high-scores dialog pop up if a high-score was achieved.
  - made high-score list taller to accommodate all 10 high scores.

v1.2 (17 Mar 2002):
  - added high score tracking
  - abandoned the Pref* API because it seemed to lose the preferences under
    certain situations -- returned to creating a "herculeDB" database.
  - autodetects highest screen-depth when first run, instead of defaulting
    to 1-bit graphics

v1.11a (11 Mar 2002):
  - added small-icon for display in listview of application launcher

v1.11 (7 Mar 2002):
  - fixed three minor bugs that cropped up occassionally:
    1) replacing a removed tile was not being added to the undo history
    2) auto-deduce was not working correctly in one particular instance
    3) clicking the right-edge of the third small tile in a square would
       selected the fourth small tile.
